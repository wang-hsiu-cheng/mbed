# Description for Each Lab Demo Problems

## lab01 Mbed Introduction
1. 
2. Please create a new program in Mbed Studio to write a program. The program will turn on LED3 for a fixed number of times (of your choice) and print a counter with the resolution of 0.1 (i.e, printing 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc.).

## lab02 Digital Input and Output
1. 
2. Please write a mbed program. The program should monitor the state of the push-button switch. When the switch's state is zero, the 7-segment display should cycle through the digits 0 through 9 in ascending order. Conversely, when the switch's state is one, the 7-segment display should cycle through the digits 9 through 0 in descending order.

## lab03 Analog Output
1. 

2. Please revise 3_2_Sawtooth_Waveform Program. Please use integer index "i" and `write_u16()` API for AnalogOut.

3. Please change the duty cycle of 3_4_PWM_Ouput and show the changed PWM waveform.

## lab04 Analog Input
1. Please change the number of samples to 256 for 4_4_FFT_analysis and demo the Python plot.

## HW1 Digital and DAC Interface
1. 
2. Please write a mbed program to show Braille codes (3 rows of 2 dots; 6-bit binary codes) with a [seven-segment display](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/braille-alphabet). The LEDs used in the seven-segment display for the 6 Braille bits are shown in the following figure. Note that numbers are prepended by a # symbol. Please try and demo a few characters with both capital letters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9), e.g., "A12".
3. Please write a mbed game to use the user button on the board and seven-segment display. (1) Push once to randomly display a number (1-9) on seven-segment display (2) Push another time to start counting down for the above number of seconds. (3) Push to stop the counting down to make it as close to 0 as possible. Of course, you should not be watching the display when guessing the count down. If the number passes 0 without being stopped, the count down will stop at 0 with "." flashing. You may start the guessing game again by pushing the user button.
4. Please write the following waveform generator. The function of first half period is `3(1 + 1/(1 - exp(x)))`, and the function of second half period is `3(1 + 1/(1 - exp(2*pi - x)))`. As in the sinewave example in lab3, please use `write_u16(unsigned short)` in AnalogOut API. Also generate the waveform with at least 360 samples per period. Please use Picoscope the verify the output waveform.

    What is the fastest (shortest) period generated by an mbed program?
    
    Please use `wait_us()` to control the period of the waveform. How do you set the wait time in `wait_us()` to generate an waveform of exact 100Hz?

## lab05 Interrupts, timers, tasks and RTOS
1. Please measure the run times of computing the `exp()` function for multiple iterations (N) using a timer. When you select a measurable N, please also try 2N, 3N, etc to demonstrate that the measured time is linearly proportional to N.
2. Please use an EventQueue to schedule a call of printf() every 30ms. The printf() will print a continuously running timer's ms values with elapsed_time()
